# TODO DEMO APP

## Instructions

- Make sure you have docker and docker-composer installed. Check both [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/) if you are on linux or [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) for windows
- Run the following commands for setting up
  <br>
  `path/to/docker-compose up -d` replace path/to with correct path.
- Once you the above command complete without any error you can access the app on http://localhost:8000 and the api part on http://localhost:9000

If anything is unclear don't hesitate to contact me for further assistance.

Note: normally I would not include api/.env file but to simplify you testing I have included it.
